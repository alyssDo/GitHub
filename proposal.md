# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Traveling With Light Using Robotics

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that lets a robot move with a light source, which will be used to navigate through a maze.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will allow a robot to move when its photoreceptors are exposed to a light source. The robot, asides from having photoreceptors, will also have wheels allowing it to move around. The robot uses Arudino, and this is where the code will be written on. This code will be uploaded to the robot allowing it to move. With the code, the robot will move when exposed to light, and can turn if one photoreceptor receives more light than the other photoreceptor. Potentially, the robot will also play a tone before it starts to move.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

I will be combining this final project with my final project from NSCI 3000 (Topics: Mind, Models, and Robots). The parts of the project that relate to 1051 include using coding using for loops, assigning variables, and using int/float. The aspects that relate to the other course involve the use of robotics, and the use of C++ in order to make the robot's wheels and photoreceptors work.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

The robot moving when exposed to a light source will be accomplished.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

To add onto this, the robot will make a sound when it starts moving, and be able to start and stop with exposure to light.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be the robot making a noise before it starts moving, traveling through the maze while following a light source, and stopping when it gets to the end of the maze.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The new skills I have had to learn for this project include learning how to wire the board of the robot so the photoreceptors will work and react to light. Additionally, I have had to learn how to write code in C++ for the photoreceptors to respond to being in the dark/being exposed to light/having one photoreceptor exposed to light but not the other. I will have to research more about how to make the robot move in response to receiving light from the photoreceptors.
