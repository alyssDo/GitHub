# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Currently, I am planning on using a project from my NSCI elective class about robotics and coding. Our current plan is to make our robot move towards a light source and then stop once it detects the light using photoreceptors. We
may also make it play something out of a speaker once it reaches the light source. (I have asked my professor if I can use the final project from her class and she gave me the okay, and I will have her email you some time next week. I
have also emailed about this on Tuesday (3/29) )

If this project is not accepted, I am also planning on making a website that tracks Animal Crossing Amiibo cards a person has collected. The cards would be seperated by series, and the user would be able to mark how many of the cards
in the series they own, see which cards they still need to collect, and see if they have completed a series or not. As well, the user will be able to look up cards by number/name in a search function. 

I also have plans on making a discord bot that plays Youtube videos/Spotify links/Soundcloud links like Groovy used to do.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I will be working by myself.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

There is a chance for the project I am doing with C++ to change depending on what my professor says about the concept. If anything changes about the project, would I be able to do the changed version and just email you what has changed?
