***

Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Currently, all the code for the robot has been completed. We are now in the progress of making the maze for the robot, and the presentation.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Currently, we are still in the progress of creating the maze for the robot. As well, there is bug in our code where the robot will play the tone, but not respond to the light at all. Testing the robot with old code also does not have it respond to the light, and requires the entire robot to be rewired for it to work again. There is a good chance the tone will not be used in the final project.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Asides from the tone issue, there have been no other problems.
